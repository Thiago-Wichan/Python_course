""" Numeric magic methods

Just like you can create ways for instances of your class to be compared with
comparison operators, you can define behavior for numeric operators. Buckle your
seat belts, folks...there's a lot of these. For organization's sake, I've split
the numeric magic methods into 5 categories: unary operators, normal arithmetic
operators, reflected arithmetic operators (more on this later), augmented
assignment, and type conversions.
